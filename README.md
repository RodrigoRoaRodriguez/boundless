# Boundless

Flat edgeless low contrast backgrounds and high contrast text, to fade away the fluff and highlight what really matters: your code.

# Bracket colorization

Boundless themes include bracket colorization, to highlight the brackets in your code. To enable the rainbow braces go to settings and turn on "Bracket Pair Colorization" (or paste the JSON below into the settings editor).

```json
  "editor.bracketPairColorization.enabled": true,
```

# Bracket Pair Guides

Boundless themes include custom rainbow bracket guides too! To highlight brackets. To enable bracket regions in your code go to settings and turn on:

```json
  "editor.guides.bracketPairs" : true,
  "editor.guides.highlightActiveIndentation" : true,
  "editor.guides.bracketPairsHorizontal" : "active",
```
